# Two-Factor Factorial Email Experiment

A two-factor factorial design was implemented to conduct an experiment to compare the open rate of emails send out by the Early Childhood Project at different days and times.

The data collected, SAS code, and final presentation are included here. This was part of an experimental design project for Montana State University in Spring 2020.
